# Ray - Solana-Based Mobile Payment App

Ray is a mobile application that leverages Solana blockchain technology to enable decentralized finance (DeFi) payments. Users can make Solana payments to merchants or friends via QR codes, and merchants can apply for soundboxes to receive payment notifications. It's more than just a payment solution; Ray connects users to a decentralized world of apps, games, NFTs, and more.

## Features

- **Solana Payments Integration**: Make payments using Solana cryptocurrency to merchants and friends.
- **Decentralized Web Support**: Add Solana-based decentralized web apps.
- **Merchant Soundbox**: Merchants can apply for soundboxes to receive real-time payment notifications.
- **QR Code Payments**: Quick and easy payments via QR codes.
- **DeFi Solution**: Payments are processed through decentralized finance protocols.
- **Open-Source and Secure**: Ensures security through open-source technology and decentralized architecture.

## Repositories

Ray's codebase is split into four repositories to handle various aspects of the app. You can find the code below:

- **Repo 1**: [Ray Frontend](https://github.com/raypayforchains/RayPayFrontend)
- **Repo 2**: [Ray Backend](https://github.com/raypayforchains/RayPayBackend)
- **Repo 3**: [Ray Mobile App](https://github.com/raypayforchains/RapPayMobileApp)

## How It Works

1. **For Users**: Users can create accounts with decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and start making Solana payments via QR codes.
2. **For Merchants**: Merchants can apply for a soundbox to receive payment confirmations through real-time voice notifications.
3. **DeFi Payments**: All payments are processed using Solana, making them faster, cheaper, and decentralized.
